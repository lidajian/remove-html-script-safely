# BUILD-IT BREAK-IT

This is a exercise of Secure Coding course. The exercise consists of two phases:

## BUILD-IT

In the build-it phase, we are required to write C program to meet the following requirement:

To protect a legacy medical device running Windows XP that must allow operators to visit a website, you want to remove all scripts from websites. Disabling scripting in the browser is not an option, as making any changes to the configuration will require recertification by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Instead you are going to create a program to run on the proxy server to strip all scripts from a webpage.

**Usage**: remove\_scripts [-i filename] [-o filename]

remove\_scripts takes in a webpage (HTML file) from stdin (or a file as specified with the –i option), and writes an equivalent webpage to stdout (or a file as specified with the –o option) will all scripts removed. All other content on the webpage must remain.

Pay close attention to the potential for scripts to appear outside of **\<script\>** tags.

Example input:

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>What Can JavaScript Do?</h1>

<p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>Click Me!</button>

</body>
</html>
```

Desired output (note that only the script is removed, and all other HTML elements, including the button remain):

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>What Can JavaScript Do?</h1>

<p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>

<button type="button">Click Me!</button>

</body>
</html>
```

All teams must include a method called “win” with no parameters that prints the message “You have obtained code execution.”

## BREAD-IT

In the break-it phase, all teams will have access to the source code of all build-it turnins. Break-it submissions will consist of scripts that demonstrate a vulnerability or bug in one or more programs. Bugs should be labeled with a category (least to most severe by list below):

**Incorrect functionality**: Program does not output correct HTML for the input.

**Crash**: Program halts with a segmentation fault or similar error

**Script still present**: Output HTML still contains Javascript

Code execution: Input causes the “win” routine to be executed. Break-it teams may not attempt to print the message “You have obtained code execution” by any other means (e.g. including it in HTML).
